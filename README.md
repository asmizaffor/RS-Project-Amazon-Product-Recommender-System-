This project demonstrates how to build a collaborative filtering recommender system using the Amazon product reviews dataset. 
The goal is to predict how a user would rate an item they have not yet seen and recommend the items with the highest predicted ratings.
The model is built using the scikit-surprise library and is designed to run efficiently in a Kaggle Notebook environment.
